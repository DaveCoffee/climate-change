      <h2>Deforestation</h2>


      <p>Deforesation is the act of cutting down trees for human advancement.
      This can also be linked with air polution too, cause as humans, we need oxygen
      which trees release when they get carbon dioxide, but if too many trees get cut down, then all the carbon dioxide gets released. 
      No trees, no oxygen! 
    
      It also distorys animals homes too, leaving them with no place to go, there is 
      a report that says in 100 years we could use up all the trees within, 
      only about 100 years.

    <h2>Air Polution</h2>
      <p>Air polution is when small particles of gases are in the air which are
      dangerous for humans to breathe in. Like when a tree gets cut down to releases
      carbon dioxide.</p>

  <div class="wildfire">
    <figure>
  <img id="wildfire" src="wildfire.jpg" alt="A picture of trees on fire">
  <h2>Wildfires</h2>
    <p>This is when forests catch on fire, mainly it's from lighting hitting
    trees. It's about 60% that are naturally caused and the other 40% is by humans, through
    cigarette butts or on purpuse, cause it's a faster way to than cutting down tress.

    “Although two thirds of our planet is water,
    we face an acute water shortage.
    The water crisis is the most pervasive ,
    most severe, and most invisible dimension of the
    ecological devastation of the earth.” Water Wars:<br>

    <h2>Water Shortage</h2>
      <p>This is mainly when natrual disasters contanimate the water and increasing the
      risk of cholera and typhoid to which children will get sick from.

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>It's so sad to see what humanity has done with the world, but we didn't know better. But now we do, sadly, it might already be too late. We just have to make sure we do our part, and <strong>protect</strong> the planet. If not for you, then for the kids of the next
    generation.
